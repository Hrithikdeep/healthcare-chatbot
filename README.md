## 📅 Day 1-2: Planning & Dataset Setup

### Step 1: Project Structure

```

├── data/
│   ├── triage_rules.json
├── llm/
│   └── llm_chain.py
├── utils/

### Step 2: Define Chatbot Conversation Flow

```
1. Greeting & Disclaimer
2. Symptom Input
3. Follow-up Questions (duration, severity, history)
4. LLM + Rule-Based Analysis
5. Triage Decision with Explanation
6. Suggestion and Resources
```

## 📅 Day 3: Rule-Based Triage System

### Core Triage Logic

A scoring system based on medical triage protocols:

**Emergency Indicators (Score: 10)**

* Chest pain + shortness of breath
* Severe head injury
* Difficulty breathing
* Severe bleeding
* Loss of consciousness

**Hospital Visit Needed (Score: 5-9)**

* High fever (>101.5°F) + multiple symptoms
* Persistent vomiting
* Severe pain (8-10/10)
* Signs of infection

**Monitor at Home (Score: 1-4)**

* Mild cold symptoms
* Minor cuts/bruises
* Low-grade fever alone
* Mild headache

### Implementation Strategy

* Symptom keyword matching
* Severity scoring algorithms
* Combination rules
* Age and risk factor modifiers

## 📅 Day 4-5: LLM Integration with LangChain

### Prompt Template

```python
# Prompt Template
prompt = PromptTemplate(
    input_variables=["symptoms", "duration", "severity", "age", "history"],
    template="""
You are a medical triage assistant. Based on the patient's symptoms,
provide a preliminary assessment.

Patient Information:
- Symptoms: {symptoms}
- Duration: {duration}
- Severity (1-10): {severity}
- Age: {age}
- Medical History: {history}

Analyze and recommend:
1. Urgency level (Low/Medium/High)
2. Brief reasoning
3. Suggested action

Remember: This is preliminary guidance only.
